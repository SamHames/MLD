# Machine Learning with OpenCV for computer vision
These lessons have been written with a certain type of learner in mind. They assume you are comfortable with writing and using Python code. They also assume a general understanding of statistical concepts. Nothing too esoteric but you should have a working knowledge of regression and significance.

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is an open-source BSD-licensed library that includes hundreds of computer vision algorithms. It is:

* Cross-platform: Windows, Mac, Linux (even Raspberry Pi)
* Languages: C++, C, Python & Java
* Wrappers: MATLAB/OCTAVE, C#, Ruby, etc
* Fast - utilizing threading, CUDA & OpenCL
* Python interface uses NumPy matrices for images
* Able to be integrated into iPhone and Android apps
* Includes machine learning algorithms (although we'll be using scikit-learn)

It can be downloaded for free from their [website](http://opencv.org) or installed via a package manager like homebrew on Macs.

What is machine learning?
Quick intro: statistics, training, un/supervised


What is an image?
Images, pixels, grayscale, colour, show pic of image matrix.
